Ensure data/raw/train.csv exists before running the pipeline.

Download the train.csv file here https://surli.cc/payzlg

Create their own local versions of these files.

Ensure these train.csv file remain ignored in Git commits

Ensure that train.csv exists in the data/raw/ folder before running

The cleaned data is stored in data/cleaned/train_cleaned.csv.

The database file urban_mobility.db is auto-generated after running load_data_to_db.py.
