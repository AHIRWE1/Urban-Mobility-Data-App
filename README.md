# Urban-Mobility-Data-App

 .gitignore Setup
To prevent pushing large files to GitHub, a .gitignore file was created including:
train.csv
train_cleaned.csv
data/cleaned/train_cleaned.csv
urban_mobility.db

Each contributor should:
Create their own local versions of these files.


Ensure these remain ignored in Git commits.
